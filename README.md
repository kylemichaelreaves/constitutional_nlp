# Constitutional NLP
This is my attempt at cleaning and eventually doing things with consequential legal texts from the United States. 
All NLP begins with cleaning text. Cleaning Supreme Court decisions poses unique challenges. 
For one, the references to other cases, laws, and statutes are embedded within the text itself. At the moment, I'm
trying to figure out the best way to excise those references from the body of the text.

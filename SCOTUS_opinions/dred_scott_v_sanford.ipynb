       " 'if it had jurisdiction  is the judgment it has given erroneous or not',\n",
       " 'the plaintiff in error  who was also the plaintiff in the court below  was  with his wife and children  held as slaves by the defendant  in the state of missouri  and he brought this action in the circuit court of the united states for that district  to assert the title of himself and his family to freedom',\n",
       " 'the declaration is in the form usually adopted in that state to try questions of this description  and contains the averment necessary to give the court jurisdiction  that he and the defendant are citizens of different states  that is  that he is a citizen of missouri  and the defendant a citizen of new york',\n",
       " 'the defendant pleaded in abatement to the jurisdiction of the court  that the plaintiff was not a citizen of the state of missouri  as alleged in his declaration  being a negro of african descent  whose ancestors were of pure african blood  and who were brought into this country and sold as slaves',\n",
       " 'to this plea the plaintiff demurred  and the defendant joined in demurrer  the court overruled the plea  and gave judgment that the defendant should answer over  and he thereupon put in sundry pleas in bar  upon which issues were joined  and at the trial the verdict and judgment were in his favor  whereupon the plaintiff brought this writ of error',\n",
       " 'before we speak of the pleas in bar  it will be proper to dispose of the questions which have arisen on the plea in abatement',\n",
       " 'that plea denies the right of the plaintiff to sue in a court of the united states  for the reasons therein stated',\n",
       " 'if the question raised by it is legally before us  and the court should be of opinion that the facts stated in it disqualify the plaintiff from becoming a citizen  in the sense in which that word is used in the constitution of the united states  then the judgment of the circuit court is erroneous  and must be reversed',\n",
       " 'it is suggested  however  that this plea is not before us  and that as the judgment in the court below on this plea was in favor of the plaintiff  he does not seek to reverse it  or bring it before the court for revision by his writ of error  and also that the defendant waived this defence by pleading over  and thereby admitted the jurisdiction of the court',\n",
       " 'but  in making this objection  we think the peculiar and limited jurisdiction of courts of the united states has not been adverted to  this peculiar and limited jurisdiction has made it necessary  in these courts  to adopt different rules and principles of pleading  so far as jurisdiction is concerned  from those which regulate courts of common law in england  and in the different states of the union which have adopted the common law rules',\n",
       " 'in these last mentioned courts  where their character and rank are analogous to that of a circuit court of the united states  in other words  where they are what the law terms courts of general jurisdiction  they are presumed to have jurisdiction  unless the contrary appears  no averment in the pleadings of the plaintiff is necessary  in order to give jurisdiction  if the defendant objects to it  he must plead it specially  and unless the fact on which he relies is found to be true by a jury  or admitted to be true by the plaintiff  the jurisdiction cannot be disputed in an appellate court',\n",
       " 'now  it is not necessary to inquire whether in courts of that description a party who pleads over in bar  when a plea to the jurisdiction has been ruled against him  does or does not waive his plea  nor whether upon a judgment in his favor on the pleas in bar  and a writ of error brought by the plaintiff  the question upon the plea in abatement would be open for revision in the appellate court  cases that may have been decided in such courts  or rules that may have been laid down by common law pleaders  can have no influence in the decision in this court  because  under the constitution and laws of the united states  the rules which govern the pleadings in its courts  in questions of jurisdiction  stand on different principles and are regulated by different laws',\n",
       " 'this difference arises  as we have said  from the peculiar character of the government of the united states  for although it is sovereign and supreme in its appropriate sphere of action  yet it does not possess all the powers which usually belong to the sovereignty of a nation  certain specified powers  enumerated in the constitution  have been conferred upon it  and neither the legislative  executive  nor judicial departments of the government can lawfully exercise any authority beyond the limits marked out by the constitution  and in regulating the judicial department  the cases in which the courts of the united states shall have jurisdiction are particularly and specifically enumerated and defined  and they are not authorized to take cognizance of any case which does not come within the description therein specified  hence  when a plaintiff sues in a court of the united states  it is necessary that he should show  in his pleading  that the suit he brings is within the jurisdiction of the court  and that he is entitled to sue there  and if he omits to do this  and should  by any oversight of the circuit court  obtain a judgment in his favor  the judgment would be reversed in the appellate court for want of jurisdiction in the court below  the jurisdiction would not be presumed  as in the case of a common law english or state court  unless the contrary appeared  but the record  when it comes before the appellate court  must show  affirmatively  that the inferior court had authority  under the constitution  to hear and determine the case  and if the plaintiff claims a right to sue in a circuit court of the united states  under that provision of the constitution which gives jurisdiction in controversies between citizens of different states  he must distinctly aver in his pleading that they are citizens of different states  and he cannot maintain his suit without showing that fact in the pleadings',\n",
       " 'this point was decided in the case of bingham v  cabot   in   dall         and ever since adhered to by the court  and in jackson v  ashton     pet         it was held that the objection to which it was open could not be waived by the opposite party  because consent of parties could not give jurisdiction',\n",
       " 'it is needless to accumulate cases on this subject  those already referred to  and the cases of capron v  van noorden   in   cr         and montalet v  murray     cr        are sufficient to show the rule of which we have spoken  the case of capron v  van noorden strikingly illustrates the difference between a common law court and a court of the united states',\n",
       " 'if  however  the fact of citizenship is averred in the declaration  and the defendant does not deny it  and put it in issue by plea in abatement  he cannot offer evidence at the trial to disprove it  and consequently cannot avail himself of the objection in the appellate court  unless the defect should be apparent in some other part of the record  for if there is no plea in abatement  and the want of jurisdiction does not appear in any other part of the transcript brought up by the writ of error  the undisputed averment of citizenship in the declaration must be taken in this court to be true  in this case  the citizenship is averred  but it is denied by the defendant in the manner required by the rules of pleading  and the fact upon which the denial is based is admitted by the demurrer  and  if the plea and demurrer  and judgment of the court below upon it  are before us upon this record  the question to be decided is  whether the facts stated in the plea are sufficient to show that the plaintiff is not entitled to sue as a citizen in a court of the united states',\n",
       " 'we think they are before us  the plea in abatement and the judgment of the court upon it  are a part of the judicial proceedings in the circuit court  and are there recorded as such  and a writ of error always brings up to the superior court the whole record of the proceedings in the court below  and in the case of the united states v  smith      wheat         this court said  that the case being brought up by writ of error  the whole record was under the consideration of this court  and this being the case in the present instance  the plea in abatement is necessarily under consideration  and it becomes  therefore  our duty to decide whether the facts stated in the plea are or are not sufficient to show that the plaintiff is not entitled to sue as a citizen in a court of the united states',\n",
       " 'this is certainly a very serious question  and one that now for the first time has been brought for decision before this court  but it is brought here by those who have a right to bring it  and it is our duty to meet it and decide it',\n",
       " 'the question is simply this  can a negro  whose ancestors were imported into this country  and sold as slaves  become a member of the political community formed and brought into existence by the constitution of the united states  and as such become entitled to all the rights  and privileges  and immunities  guarantied by that instrument to the citizen  one of which rights is the privilege of suing in a court of the united states in the cases specified in the constitution',\n",
       " 'it will be observed  that the plea applies to that class of persons only whose ancestors were negroes of the african race  and imported into this country  and sold and held as slaves  the only matter in issue before the court  therefore  is  whether the descendants of such slaves  when they shall be emancipated  or who are born of parents who had become free before their birth  are citizens of a state  in the sense in which the word citizen is used in the constitution of the united states  and this being the only matter in dispute on the pleadings  the court must be understood as speaking in this opinion of that class only  that is  of those persons who are the descendants of africans who were imported into this country  and sold as slaves',\n",
       " 'the situation of this population was altogether unlike that of the indian race  the latter  it is true  formed no part of the colonial communities  and never amalgamated with them in social connections or in government  but although they were uncivilized  they were yet a free and independent people  associated together in nations or tribes  and governed by their own laws  many of these political communities were situated in territories to which the white race claimed the ultimate right of dominion  but that claim was acknowledged to be subject to the right of the indians to occupy it as long as they thought proper  and neither the english nor colonial governments claimed or exercised any dominion over the tribe or nation by whom it was occupied  nor claimed the right to the possession of the territory  until the tribe or nation consented to cede it  these indian governments were regarded and treated as foreign governments  as much so as if an ocean had separated the red man from the white  and their freedom has constantly been acknowledged  from the time of the first emigration to the english colonies to the present day  by the different governments which succeeded each other  treaties have been negotiated with them  and their alliance sought for in war  and the people who compose these indian political communities have always been treated as foreigners not living under our government  it is true that the course of events has brought the indian tribes within the limits of the united states under subjection to the white race  and it has been found necessary  for their sake as well as our own  to regard them as in a state of pupilage  and to legislate to a certain extent over them and the territory they occupy  but they may  without doubt  like the subjects of any other foreign government  be naturalized by the authority of congress  and become citizens of a state  and of the united states  and if an individual should leave his nation or tribe  and take up his abode among the white population  he would be entitled to all the rights and privileges which would belong to an emigrant from any other foreign people',\n",
       " 'we proceed to examine the case as presented by the pleadings',\n",
       " 'the words  people of the united states  and  citizens  are synonymous terms  and mean the same thing  they both describe the political body who  according to our republican institutions  form the sovereignty  and who hold the power and conduct the government through their representatives  they are what we familiarly call the  sovereign people   and every citizen is one of this people  and a constituent member of this sovereignty  the question before us is  whether the class of persons described in the plea in abatement compose a portion of this people  and are constituent members of this sovereignty  we think they are not  and that they are not included  and were not intended to be included  under the word  citizens  in the constitution  and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the united states  on the contrary  they were at that time considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings  who had been subjugated by the dominant race  and  whether emancipated or not  yet remained subject to their authority  and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the government might choose to grant them',\n",
       " 'it is not the province of the court to decide upon the justice or injustice  the policy or impolicy  of these laws  the decision of that question belonged to the political or law making power  to those who formed the sovereignty and framed the constitution  the duty of the court is  to interpret the instrument they have framed  with the best lights we can obtain on the subject  and to administer it as we find it  according to its true intent and meaning when it was adopted',\n",
       " 'in discussing this question  we must not confound the rights of citizenship which a state may confer within its own limits  and the rights of citizenship as a member of the union  it does not by any means follow  because he has all the rights and privileges of a citizen of a state  that he must be a citizen of the united states  he may have all of the rights and privileges of the citizen of a state  and yet not be entitled to the rights and privileges of a citizen in any other state  for  previous to the adoption of the constitution of the united states  every state had the undoubted right to confer on whomsoever it pleased the character of citizen  and to endow him with all its rights  but this character of course was confined to the boundaries of the state  and gave him no rights or privileges in other states beyond those secured to him by the laws of nations and the comity of states  nor have the several states surrendered the power of conferring these rights and privileges by adopting the constitution of the united states  each state may still confer them upon an alien  or any one it thinks proper  or upon any class or description of persons  yet he would not be a citizen in the sense in which that word is used in the constitution of the united states  nor entitled to sue as such in one of its courts  nor to the privileges and immunities of a citizen in the other states  the rights which he would acquire would be restricted to the state which gave them  the constitution has conferred on congress the right to establish an uniform rule of naturalization  and this right is evidently exclusive  and has always been held by this court to be so  consequently  no state  since the adoption of the constitution  can by naturalizing an alien invest him with the rights and privileges secured to a citizen of a state under the federal government  although  so far as the state alone was concerned  he would undoubtedly be entitled to the rights of a citizen  and clothed with all the rights and immunities which the constitution and laws of the state attached to that character',\n",
       " 'it is very clear  therefore  that no state can  by any act or law of its own  passed since the adoption of the constitution  introduce a new member into the political community created by the constitution of the united states  it cannot make him a member of this community by making him a member of its own  and for the same reason it cannot introduce any person  or description of persons  who were not intended to be embraced in this new political family  which the constitution brought into existence  but were intended to be excluded from it',\n",
       " 'the question then arises  whether the provisions of the constitution  in relation to the personal rights and privileges to which the citizen of a state should be entitled  embraced the negro african race  at that time in this country  or who might afterwards be imported  who had then or should afterwards be made free in any state  and to put it in the power of a single state to make him a citizen of the united states  and endue him with the full rights of citizenship in every other state without their consent  does the constitution of the united states act upon him whenever he shall be made free under the laws of a state  and raised there to the rank of a citizen  and immediately clothe him with all the privileges of a citizen in every other state  and in its own courts',\n",
       " 'the court think the affirmative of these propositions cannot be maintained  and if it cannot  the plaintiff in error could not be a citizen of the state of missouri  within the meaning of the constitution of the united states  and  consequently  was not entitled to sue in its courts',\n",
       " 'it is true  every person  and every class and description of persons  who were at the time of the adoption of the constitution recognised as citizens in the several states  became also citizens of this new political body  but none other  it was formed by them  and for them and their posterity  but for no one else  and the personal rights and privileges guarantied to citizens of this new sovereignty were intended to embrace those only who were then members of the several state communities  or who should afterwards by birthright or otherwise become members  according to the provisions of the constitution and the principles on which it was founded  it was the union of those who were at that time members of distinct and separate political communities into one political family  whose power  for certain specified purposes  was to extend over the whole territory of the united states  and it gave to each citizen rights and privileges outside of his state which he did not before possess  and placed him in every other state upon a perfect equality with its own citizens as to rights of person and rights of property  it made him a citizen of the united states',\n",
       " 'it becomes necessary  therefore  to determine who were citizens of the several states when the constitution was adopted  and in order to do this  we must recur to the governments and institutions of the thirteen colonies  when they separated from great britain and formed new sovereignties  and took their places in the family of independent nations  we must inquire who  at that time  were recognised as the people or citizens of a state  whose rights and liberties had been outraged by the english government  and who declared their independence  and assumed the powers of government to defend their rights by force of arms',\n",
       " 'in the opinion of the court  the legislation and histories of the times  and the language used in the declaration of independence  show  that neither the class of persons who had been imported as slaves  nor their descendants  whether they had become free or not  were then acknowledged as a part of the people  nor intended to be included in the general words used in that memorable instrument',\n",
       " 'it is difficult at this day to realize the state of public opinion in relation to that unfortunate race  which prevailed in the civilized and enlightened portions of the world at the time of the declaration of independence  and when the constitution of the united states was framed and adopted  but the public history of every european nation displays it in a manner too plain to be mistaken',\n",
       " 'they had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order  and altogether unfit to associate with the white race  either in social or political relations  and so far inferior  that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect  and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit  he was bought and sold  and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise and traffic  whenever a profit could be made by it  this opinion was at that time fixed and universal in the civilized portion of the white race  it was regarded as an axiom in morals as well as in politics  which no one thought of disputing  or supposed to be open to dispute  and men in every grade and position in society daily and habitually acted upon it in their private pursuits  as well as in matters of public concern  without doubting for a moment the correctness of this opinion',\n",
       " 'and in no nation was this opinion more firmly fixed or more uniformly acted upon than by the english government and english people  they not only seized them on the coast of africa  and sold them or held them in slavery for their own use  but they took them as ordinary articles of merchandise to every country where they could make a profit on them  and were far more extensively engaged in this commerce than any other nation in the world',\n",
       " 'the opinion thus entertained and acted upon in england was naturally impressed upon the colonies they founded on this side of the atlantic  and  accordingly  a negro of the african race was regarded by them as an article of property  and held  and bought and sold as such  in every one of the thirteen colonies which united in the declaration of independence  and afterwards formed the constitution of the united states  the slaves were more or less numerous in the different colonies  as slave labor was found more or less profitable  but no one seems to have doubted the correctness of the prevailing opinion of the time',\n",
       " 'the legislation of the different colonies furnishes positive and indisputable proof of this fact',\n",
       " 'it would be tedious  in this opinion  to enumerate the various laws they passed upon this subject  it will be sufficient  as a sample of the legislation which then generally prevailed throughout the british colonies  to give the laws of two of them  one being still a large slaveholding state  and the other the first state in which slavery ceased to exist',\n",
       " 'the province of maryland  in        ch      s      passed a law declaring  that if any free negro or mulatto intermarry with any white woman  or if any white man shall intermarry with any negro or mulatto woman  such negro or mulatto shall become a slave during life  excepting mulattoes born of white women  who  for such intermarriage  shall only become servants for seven years  to be disposed of as the justices of the county court  where such marriage so happens  shall think fit  to be applied by them towards the support of a public school within the said county  and any white man or white woman who shall intermarry as aforesaid  with any negro or mulatto  such white man or white woman shall become servants during the term of seven years  and shall be disposed of by the justices as aforesaid  and be applied to the uses aforesaid',\n",
       " 'the other colonial law to which we refer was passed by massachusetts in        chap      it is entitled  an act for the better preventing of a spurious and mixed issue    c   and it provides  that  if any negro or mulatto shall presume to smite or strike any person of the english or other christian nation  such negro or mulatto shall be severely whipped  at the discretion of the justices before whom the offender shall be convicted',\n",
       " 'and  that none of her majesty s english or scottish subjects  nor of any other christian nation  within this province  shall contract matrimony with any negro or mulatto  nor shall any person  duly authorized to solemnize marriage  presume to join any such in marriage  on pain of forfeiting the sum of fifty pounds  one moiety thereof to her majesty  for and towards the support of the government within this province  and the other moiety to him or them that shall inform and sue for the same  in any of her majesty s courts of record within the province  by bill  plaint  or information',\n",
       " 'we give both of these laws in the words used by the respective legislative bodies  because the language in which they are framed  as well as the provisions contained in them  show  too plainly to be misunderstood  the degraded condition of this unhappy race  they were still in force when the revolution began  and are a faithful index to the state of feeling towards the class of persons of whom they speak  and of the position they occupied throughout the thirteen colonies  in the eyes and thoughts of the men who framed the declaration of independence and established the state constitutions and governments  they show that a perpetual and impassable barrier was intended to be erected between the white race and the one which they had reduced to slavery  and governed as subjects with absolute and despotic power  and which they then looked upon as so far below them in the scale of created beings  that intermarriages between white persons and negroes or mulattoes were regarded as unnatural and immoral  and punished as crimes  not only in the parties  but in the person who joined them in marriage  and no distinction in this respect was made between the free negro or mulatto and the slave  but this stigma  of the deepest degradation  was fixed upon the whole race',\n",
       " 'we refer to these historical facts for the purpose of showing the fixed opinions concerning that race  upon which the statesmen of that day spoke and acted  it is necessary to do this  in order to determine whether the general terms used in the constitution of the united states  as to the rights of man and the rights of the people  was intended to include them  or to give to them or their posterity the benefit of any of its provisions',\n",

       " 'but there are two clauses in the constitution which point directly and specifically to the negro race as a separate class of persons  and show clearly that they were not regarded as a portion of the people or citizens of the government then formed',\n",

       " 'no one of that race had ever migrated to the united states voluntarily  all of them had been brought here as articles of merchandise  the number that had been emancipated at that time were but few in comparison with those held in slavery  and they were identified in the public mind with the race to which they belonged  and regarded as a part of the slave population rather than the free  it is obvious that they were not even in the minds of the framers of the constitution when they were conferring special rights and privileges upon the citizens of a state in every other part of the union',\n",
       " 'indeed  when we look to the condition of this race in the several states at the time  it is impossible to believe that these rights and privileges were intended to be extended to them',\n",

       " 'a clause similar to the one in the constitution  in relation to the rights and immunities of citizens of one state in the other states  was contained in the articles of confederation  but there is a difference of language  which is worthy of note  the provision in the articles of confederation was   that the free inhabitants of each of the states  paupers  vagabonds  and fugitives from justice  excepted  should be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states',\n",

       " 'but although this clause of the articles of confederation is the same in principle with that inserted in the constitution  yet the comprehensive word inhabitant  which might be construed to include an emancipated slave  is omitted  and the privilege is confined to citizens of the state  and this alteration in words would hardly have been made  unless a different meaning was intended to be conveyed  or a possible doubt removed  the just and fair inference is  that as this privilege was about to be placed under the protection of the general government  and the words expounded by its tribunals  and all power in relation to it taken from the state and its courts  it was deemed prudent to describe with precision and caution the persons to whom this high privilege was givenand the word citizen was on that account substituted for the words free inhabitant  the word citizen excluded  and no doubt intended to exclude  foreigners who had not become citizens of some one of the states when the constitution was adopted  and also every description of persons who were not fully recognised as citizens in the several states  this  upon any fair construction of the instruments to which we have referred  was evidently the object and purpose of this change of words',\n",

       " 'legrand  therefore  raised no objection to the jurisdiction of the court in the suit at law  because he was himself anxious to obtain the judgment of the court upon his title  consequently  there was nothing in the record before the court to show that darnall was of african descent  and the usual judgment and award of execution was entered  and legrand thereupon filed his bill on the equity side of the circuit court  stating that darnall was born a slave  and had not been legally emancipated  and could not therefore take the land devised to him  nor make legrand a good title  and praying an injunction to restrain darnall from proceeding to execution on the judgment  which was granted  darnall answered  averring in his answer that he was a free man  and capable of conveying a good title  testimony was taken on this point  and at the hearing the circuit court was of opinion that darnall was a free man and his title good  and dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill  and that decree was affirmed here  upon the appeal of legrand',\n",
       " 'now  it is difficult to imagine how any question about the citizenship of darnall  or his right to sue in that character  can be supposed to have arisen or been decided in that case  the fact that he was of african descent was first brought before the court upon the bill in equity  the suit at law had then passed into judgment and award of execution  and the circuit court  as a court of law  had no longer any authority over it  it was a valid and legal judgment  which the court that rendered it had not the power to reverse or set aside  and unless it had jurisdiction as a court of equity to restrain him from using its process as a court of law  darnall  if he thought proper  would have been at liberty to proceed on his judgment  and compel the payment of the money  although the allegations in the bill were true  and he was incapable of making a title  no other court could have enjoined him  for certainly no state equity court could interfere in that way with the judgment of a circuit court of the united states',\n",
       " 'but the circuit court as a court of equity certainly had equity jurisdiction over its own judgment as a court of law  without regard to the character of the parties  and had not only the right  but it was its dutyno matter who were the parties in the judgmentto prevent them from proceeding to enforce it by execution  if the court was satisfied that the money was not justly and equitably due  the ability of darnall to convey did not depend upon his citizenship  but upon his title to freedom  and if he was free  he could hold and convey property  by the laws of maryland  although he was not a citizen  but if he was by law still a slave  he could not  it was therefore the duty of the court  sitting as a court of equity in the latter case  to prevent him from using its process  as a court of common law  to compel the payment of the purchase money  when it was evident that the purchaser must lose the land  but if he was free  and could make a title  it was equally the duty of the court not to suffer legrand to keep the land  and refuse the payment of the money  upon the ground that darnall was incapable of suing or being sued as a citizen in a court of the united states  the character or citizenship of the parties had no connection with the question of jurisdiction  and the matter in dispute had no relation to the citizenship of darnall  nor is such a question alluded to in the opinion of the court',\n",
       " 'besides  we are by no means prepared to say that there are not many cases  civil as well as criminal  in which a circuit court of the united states may exercise jurisdiction  although one of the african race is a party  that broad question is not before the court  the question with which we are now dealing is  whether a person of the african race can be a citizen of the united states  and become thereby entitled to a special privilege  by virtue of his title to that character  and which  under the constitution  no one but a citizen can claim  it is manifest that the case of legrand and darnall has no bearing on that question  and can have no application to the case now before the court',\n",
       " 'this case  however  strikingly illustrates the consequences that would follow the construction of the constitution which would give the power contended for to a state  it would in effect give it also to an individual  for if the father of young darnall had manumitted him in his lifetime  and sent him to reside in a state which recognised him as a citizen  he might have visited and sojourned in maryland when he pleased  and as long as he pleased  as a citizen of the united states  and the state officers and tribunals would be compelled  by the paramount authority of the constitution  to receive him and treat him as one of its citizens  exempt from the laws and police of the state in relation to a person of that description  and allow him to enjoy all the rights and privileges of citizenship  without respect to the laws of maryland  although such laws were deemed by it absolutely essential to its own safety',\n",
       " 'the only two provisions which point to them and include them  treat them as property  and make it the duty of the government to protect it  no other power  in relation to this race  is to be found in the constitution  and as it is a government of special  delegated  powers  no authority beyond these two provisions can be constitutionally exercised  the government of the united states had no right to interfere for any other purpose but that of protecting the rights of the owner  leaving it altogether with the several states to deal with this race  whether emancipated or not  as each state may think justice  humanity  and the interests and safety of society  require  the states evidently intended to reserve this power exclusively to themselves',\n",
       " 'no one  we presume  supposes that any change in public opinion or feeling  in relation to this unfortunate race  in the civilized nations of europe or in this country  should induce the court to give to the words of the constitution a more liberal construction in their favor than they were intended to bear when the instrument was framed and adopted  such an argument would be altogether inadmissible in any tribunal called on to interpret it  if any of its provisions are deemed unjust  there is a mode prescribed in the instrument itself by which it may be amended  but while it remains unaltered  it must be construed now as it was understood at the time of its adoption  it is not only the same in words  but the same in meaning  and delegates the same powers to the government  and reserves and secures the same rights and privileges to the citizen  and as long as it continues to exist in its present form  it speaks not only in the same words  but with the same meaning and intent with which it spoke when it came from the hands of its framers  and was voted on and adopted by the people of the united states  any other rule of construction would abrogate the judicial character of this court  and make it the mere reflex of the popular opinion or passion of the day  this court was not created by the constitution for such purposes  higher and graver trusts have been confided to it  and it must not falter in the path of duty',\n",
       " 'what the construction was at that time  we think can hardly admit of doubt  we have the language of the declaration of independence and of the articles of confederation  in addition to the plain words of the constitution itself  we have the legislation of the different states  before  about the time  and since  the constitution was adopted  we have the legislation of congress  from the time of its adoption to a recent period  and we have the constant and uniform action of the executive department  all concurring together  and leading to the same result  and if anything in relation to the construction of the constitution can be regarded as settled  it is that which we now give to the word  citizen  and the word  people',\n",
       " 'and upon a full and careful consideration of the subject  the court is of opinion  that  upon the facts stated in the plea in abatement  dred scott was not a citizen of missouri within the meaning of the constitution of the united states  and not entitled as such to sue in its courts  and  consequently  that the circuit court had no jurisdiction of the case  and that the judgment on the plea in abatement is erroneous',\n",
       " 'we are aware that doubts are entertained by some of the members of the court  whether the plea in abatement is legally before the court upon this writ of error  but if that plea is regarded as waived  or out of the case upon any other ground  yet the question as to the jurisdiction of the circuit court is presented on the face of the bill of exception itself  taken by the plaintiff at the trial  for he admits that he and his wife were born slaves  but endeavors to make out his title to freedom and citizenship by showing that they were taken by their owner to certain places  hereinafter mentioned  where slavery could not by law exist  and that they thereby became free  and upon their return to missouri became citizens of that state',\n",
       " 'now  if the removal of which he speaks did not give them their freedom  then by his own admission he is still a slave  and whatever opinions may be entertained in favor of the citizenship of a free person of the african race  no one supposes that a slave is a citizen of the state or of the united states  if  therefore  the acts done by his owner did not make them free persons  he is still a slave  and certainly incapable of suing in the character of a citizen',\n",
       " 'the principle of law is too well settled to be disputed  that a court can give no judgment for either party  where it has no jurisdiction  and if  upon the showing of scott himself  it appeared that he was still a slave  the case ought to have been dismissed  and the judgment against him and in favor of the defendant for costs  is  like that on the plea in abatement  erroneous  and the suit ought to have been dismissed by the circuit court for want of jurisdiction in that court',\n",
       " 'but  before we proceed to examine this part of the case  it may be proper to notice an objection taken to the judicial authority of this court to decide it  and it has been said  that as this court has decided against the jurisdiction of the circuit court on the plea in abatement  it has no right to examine any question presented by the exception  and that anything it may say upon that part of the case will be extra judicial  and mere obiter dicta',\n",
       " 'this is a manifest mistake  there can be no doubt as to the jurisdiction of this court to revise the judgment of a circuit court  and to reverse it for any error apparent on the record  whether it be the error of giving judgment in a case over which it had no jurisdiction  or any other material error  and this  too  whether there is a plea in abatement or not',\n",
       " 'the objection appears to have arisen from confounding writs of error to a state court  with writs of error to a circuit court of the united states  undoubtedly  upon a writ of error to a state court  unless the record shows a case that gives jurisdiction  the case must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court  and if it is dismissed on that ground  we have no right to examine and decide upon any question presented by the bill of exceptions  or any other part of the record  but writs of error to a state court  and to a circuit court of the united states  are regulated by different laws  and stand upon entirely different principles  and in a writ of error to a circuit court of the united states  the whole record is before this court for examination and decision  and if the sum in controversy is large enough to give jurisdiction  it is not only the right  but it is the judicial duty of the court  to examine the whole case as presented by the record  and if it appears upon its face that any material error or errors have been committed by the court below  it is the duty of this court to reverse the judgment  and remand the case  and certainly an error in passing a judgment upon the merits in favor of either party  in a case which it was not authorized to try  and over which it had no jurisdiction  is as grave an error as a court can commit',\n",
       " 'the plea in abatement is not a plea to the jurisdiction of this court  but to the jurisdiction of the circuit court  and it appears by the record before us  that the circuit court committed an error  in deciding that it had jurisdiction  upon the facts in the case  admitted by the pleadings  it is the duty of the appellate tribunal to correct this error  but that could not be done by dismissing the case for want of jurisdiction herefor that would leave the erroneous judgment in full force  and the injured party without remedy  and the appellate court therefore exercises the power for which alone appellate courts are constituted  by reversing the judgment of the court below for this error  it exercises its proper and appropriate jurisdiction over the judgment and proceedings of the circuit court  as they appear upon the record brought up by the writ of error',\n",
       " 'the correction of one error in the court below does not deprive the appellate court of the power of examining further into the record  and correcting any other material errors which may have been committed by the inferior court  there is certainly no rule of lawnor any practicenor any decision of a courtwhich even questions this power in the appellate tribunal  on the contrary  it is the daily practice of this court  and of all appellate courts where they reverse the judgment of an inferior court for error  to correct by its opinions whatever errors may appear on the record material to the case  and they have always held it to be their duty to do so where the silence of the court might lead to misconstruction or future controversy  and the point has been relied on by either side  and argued before the court',\n",
       " 'in the case before us  we have already decided that the circuit court erred in deciding that it had jurisdiction upon the facts admitted by the pleadings  and it appears that  in the further progress of the case  it acted upon the erroneous principle it had decided on the pleadings  and gave judgment for the defendant  where  upon the facts admitted in the exception  it had no jurisdiction',\n",
       " 'we are at a loss to understand upon what principle of law  applicable to appellate jurisdiction  it can be supposed that this court has not judicial authority to correct the last mentioned error  because they had before corrected the former  or by what process of reasoning it can be made out  that the error of an inferior court in actually pronouncing judgment for one of the parties  in a case in which it had no jurisdiction  cannot be looked into or corrected by this court  because we have decided a similar question presented in the pleadings  the last point is distinctly presented by the facts contained in the plaintiff s own bill of exceptions  which he himself brings here by this writ of error  it was the point which chiefly occupied the attention of the counsel on both sides in the argumentand the judgment which this court must render upon both errors is precisely the same  it must  in each of them  exercise jurisdiction over the judgment  and reverse it for the errors committed by the court below  and issue a mandate to the circuit court to conform its judgment to the opinion pronounced by this court  by dismissing the case for want of jurisdiction in the circuit court  this is the constant and invariable practice of this court  where it reverses a judgment for want of jurisdiction in the circuit court',\n",
       " 'it can scarcely be necessary to pursue such a question further  the want of jurisdiction in the court below may appear on the record without any plea in abatement  this is familiarly the case where a court of chancery has exercised jurisdiction in a case where the plaintiff had a plain and adequate remedy at law  and it so appears by the transcript when brought here by appeal  so also where it appears that a court of admiralty has exercised jurisdiction in a case belonging exclusively to a court of common law  in these cases there is no plea in abatement  and for the same reason  and upon the same principles  where the defect of jurisdiction is patent on the record  this court is bound to reverse the judgment  although the defendant has not pleaded in abatement to the jurisdiction of the inferior court',\n",
       " 'the cases of jackson v  ashton and of capron v  van noorden  to which we have referred in a previous part of this opinion  are directly in point  in the last mentioned case  capron brought an action against van noorden in a circuit court of the united states  without showing  by the usual averments of citizenship  that the court had jurisdiction  there was no plea in abatement put in  and the parties went to trial upon the merits  the court gave judgment in favor of the defendant with costs  the plaintiff thereupon brought his writ of error  and this court reversed the judgment given in favor of the defendant  and remanded the case with directions to dismiss it  because it did not appear by the transcript that the circuit court had jurisdiction',\n",
       " 'the case before us still more strongly imposes upon this court the duty of examining whether the court below has not committed an error  in taking jurisdiction and giving a judgment for costs in favor of the defendant  for in capron v  van noorden the judgment was reversed  because it did not appear that the parties were citizens of different states  they might or might not be  but in this case it does appear that the plaintiff was born a slave  and if the facts upon which he relies have not made him free  then it appears affirmatively on the record that he is not a citizen  and consequently his suit against sandford was not a suit between citizens of different states  and the court had no authority to pass any judgment between the parties  the suit ought  in this view of it  to have been dismissed by the circuit court  and its judgment in favor of sandford is erroneous  and must be reversed',\n",
       " 'it is true that the result either way  by dismissal or by a judgment for the defendant  makes very little  if any  difference in a pecuniary or personal point of view to either party  but the fact that the result would be very nearly the same to the parties in either form of judgment  would not justify this court in sanctioning an error in the judgment which is patent on the record  and which  if sanctioned  might be drawn into precedent  and lead to serious mischief and injustice in some future suit',\n",
       " 'we proceed  therefore  to inquire whether the facts relied on by the plaintiff entitled him to his freedom',\n",

       " 'in considering this part of the controversy  two questions arise     was he  together with his family  free in missouri by reason of the stay in the territory of the united states hereinbefore mentioned  and    if they were not  is scott himself free by reason of his removal to rock island  in the state of illinois  as stated in the above admissions',\n",
       " 'we proceed to examine the first question',\n",
       " 'the act of congress  upon which the plaintiff relies  declares that slavery and involuntary servitude  except as a punishment for crime  shall be forever prohibited in all that part of the territory ceded by france  under the name of louisiana  which lies north of thirty six degrees thirty minutes north latitude  and not included within the limits of missouri  and the difficulty which meets us at the threshold of this part of the inquiry is  whether congress was authorized to pass this law under any of the powers granted to it by the constitution  for if the authority is not given by that instrument  it is the duty of this court to declare it void and inoperative  and incapable of conferring freedom upon any one who is held as a slave under the have of any one of the states',\n",
       " 'the counsel for the plaintiff has laid much stress upon that article in the constitution which confers on congress the power  to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states   but  in the judgment of the court  that provision has no bearing on the present controversy  and the power there given  whatever it may be  is confined  and was intended to be confined  to the territory which at that time belonged to  or was claimed by  the united states  and was within their boundaries as settled by the treaty with great britain  and can have no influence upon a territory afterwards acquired from a foreign government  it was a special provision for a known and particular territory  and to meet a present emergency  and nothing more',\n",
       " 'a brief summary of the history of the times  as well as the careful and measured terms in which the article is framed  will show the correctness of this proposition',\n",
       " 'it will be remembered that  from the commencement of the revolutionary war  serious difficulties existed between the states  in relation to the disposition of large and unsettled territories which were included in the chartered limits of some of the states  and some of the other states  and more especially maryland  which had no unsettled lands  insisted that as the unoccupied lands  if wrested from great britain  would owe their preservation to the common purse and the common sword  the money arising from them ought to be applied in just proportion among the several states to pay the expenses of the war  and ought not to be appropriated to the use of the state in whose chartered limits they might happen to lie  to the exclusion of the other states  by whose combined efforts and common expense the territory was defended and preserved against the claim of the british government',\n",
       " 'these difficulties caused much uneasiness during the war  while the issue was in some degree doubtful  and the future boundaries of the united states yet to be defined by treaty  if we achieved our independence',\n",
       " 'the majority of the congress of the confederation obviously concurred in opinion with the state of maryland  and desired to obtain from the states which claimed it a cession of this territory  in order that congress might raise money on this security to carry on the war  this appears by the resolution passed on the  th of september        strongly urging the states to cede these lands to the united states  both for the sake of peace and union among themselves  and to maintain the public credit  and this was followed by the resolution of october   th        by which congress pledged itself  that if the lands were ceded  as recommended by the resolution above mentioned  they should be disposed of for the common benefit of the united states  and be settled and formed into distinct republican states  which should become members of the federal union  and have the same rights of sovereignty  and freedom  and independence  as other states',\n",
       " 'but these difficulties became much more serious after peace took place  and the boundaries of the united states were established  every state  at that time  felt severely the pressure of its war debt  but in virginia  and some other states  there were large territories of unsettled lands  the sale of which would enable them to discharge their obligations without much inconvenience  while other states  which had no such resource  saw before them many years of heavy and burdensome taxation  and the latter insisted  for the reasons before stated  that these unsettled lands should be treated as the common property of the states  and the proceeds applied to their common benefit',\n",
       " 'the letters from the statesmen of that day will show how much this controversy occupied their thoughts  and the dangers that were apprehended from it  it was the disturbing element of the time  and fears were entertained that it might dissolve the confederation by which the states were then united',\n",
       " 'these fears and dangers were  however  at once removed  when the state of virginia  in       voluntarily ceded to the united states the immense tract of country lying northwest of the river ohio  and which was within the acknowledged limits of the state  the only object of the state  in making this cession  was to put an end to the threatening and exciting controversy  and to enable the congress of that time to dispose of the lands  and appropriate the proceeds as a common fund for the common benefit of the states  it was not ceded  because it was inconvenient to the state to hold and govern it  nor from any expectation that it could be better or more conveniently governed by the united states',\n",
       " 'the example of virginia was soon afterwards followed by other states  and  at the time of the adoption of the constitution  all of the states  similarly situated  had ceded their unappropriated lands  except north carolina and georgia  the main object for which these cessions were desired and made  was on account of their money value  and to put an end to a dangerous controversy  as to who was justly entitled to the proceeds when the lands should be sold  it is necessary to bring this part of the history of these cessions thus distinctly into view  because it will enable us the better to comprehend the phraseology of the article in the constitution  so often referred to in the argument',\n",
       " 'undoubtedly the powers of sovereignty and the eminent domain were ceded with the land  this was essential  in order to make it effectual  and to accomplish its objects  but it must be remembered that  at that time  there was no government of the united states in existence with enumerated and limited powers  what was then called the united states  were thirteen separate  sovereign  independent states  which had entered into a league or confederation for their mutual protection and advantage  and the congress of the united states was composed of the representatives of these separate sovereignties  meeting together  as equals  to discuss and decide on certain measures which the states  by the articles of confederation  had agreed to submit to their decision  but this confederation had none of the attributes of sovereignty in legislative  executive  or judicial power  it was little more than a congress of ambassadors  authorized to represent separate nations  in matters in which they had a common concern',\n",
       " 'it was this congress that accepted the cession from virginia  they had no power to accept it under the articles of confederation  but they had an undoubted right  as independent sovereignties  to accept any cession of territory for their common benefit  which all of them assented to  and it is equally clear  that as their common property  and having no superior to control them  they had the right to exercise absolute dominion over it  subject only to the restrictions which virginia had imposed in her act of cession  there was  as we have said  no government of the united states then in existence with special enumerated and limited powers  the territory belonged to sovereignties  who  subject to the limitations above mentioned  had a right to establish any form of government they pleased  by compact or treaty among themselves  and to regulate rights of person and rights of property in the territory  as they might deem proper  it was by a congress  representing the authority of these several and separate sovereignties  and acting under their authority and command   but not from any authority derived from the articles of confederation   that the instrument usually called the ordinance of      was adopted  regulating in much detail the principles and the laws by which this territory should be governed  and among other provisions  slavery is prohibited in it  we do not question the power of the states  by agreement among themselves  to pass this ordinance  nor its obligatory force in the territory  while the confederation or league of the states in their separate sovereign character continued to exist',\n",
       " 'this was the state of things when the constitution of the united states was formed  the territory ceded by virginia belonged to the several confederated states as common property  and they had united in establishing in it a system of government and jurisprudence  in order to prepare it for admission as states  according to the terms of the cession  they were about to dissolve this federative union  and to surrender a portion of their independent sovereignty to a new government  which  for certain purposes  would make the people of the several states one people  and which was to be supreme and controlling within its sphere of action throughout the united states  but this government was to be carefully limited in its powers  and to exercise no authority beyond those expressly granted by the constitution  or necessarily to be implied from the language of the instrument  and the objects it was intended to accomplish  and as this league of states would  upon the adoption of the new government  cease to have any power over the territory  and the ordinance they had agreed upon be incapable of execution  and a mere nullity  it was obvious that some provision was necessary to give the new government sufficient power to enable it to carry into effect the objects for which it was ceded  and the compacts and agreements which the states had made with each other in the exercise of their powers of sovereignty  it was necessary that the lands should be sold to pay the war debt  that a government and system of jurisprudence should be maintained in it  to protect the citizens of the united states who should migrate to the territory  in their rights of person and of property  it was also necessary that the new government  about to be adopted  should be authorized to maintain the claim of the united states to the unappropriated lands in north carolina and georgia  which had not then been ceded  but the cession of which was confidently anticipated upon some terms that would be arranged between the general government and these two states  and  moreover  there were many articles of value besides this property in land  such as arms  military stores  munitions  and ships of war  which were the common property of the states  when acting in their independent characters as confederates  which neither the new government nor any one else would have a right to take possession of  or control  without authority from them  and it was to place these things under the guardianship and protection of the new government  and to clothe it with the necessary powers  that the clause was inserted in the constitution which give congress the power  to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states   it was intended for a specific purpose  to provide for the things we have mentioned  it was to transfer to the new government the property then held in common by the states  and to give to that government power to apply it to the objects for which it had been destined by mutual agreement among the states before their league was dissolved  it applied only to the property which the states held in common at that time  and has no reference whatever to any territory or other property which the new sovereignty might afterwards itself acquire',\n",
       " 'the language used in the clause  the arrangement and combination of the powers  and the somewhat unusual phraseology it uses  when it speaks of the political power to be exercised in the government of the territory  all indicate the design and meaning of the clause to be such as we have mentioned  it does not speak of any territory  nor of territories  but uses language which  according to its legitimate meaning  points to a particular thing  the power is given in relation only to the territory of the united statesthat is  to a territory then in existence  and then known or claimed as the territory of the united states  it begins its enumeration of powers by that of disposing  in other words  making sale of the lands  or raising money from them  which  as we have already said  was the main object of the cession  and which is accordingly the first thing provided for in the article  it then gives the power which was necessarily associated with the disposition and sale of the landsthat is  the power of making needful rules and regulations respecting the territory  and whatever construction may now be given to these words  every one  we think  must admit that they are not the words usually employed by statesmen in giving supreme power of legislation  they are certainly very unlike the words used in the power granted to legislate over territory which the new government might afterwards itself obtain by cession from a state  either for its seat of government  or for forts  magazines  arsenals  dock yards  and other needful buildings',\n",

       " 'as a practical illustration of the principle  we may refer to the legislation of the free states in abolishing slavery  and prohibiting its introduction into their territories  confessedly  except as restrained by the federal constitution  they exercised  and rightfully  complete and absolute power over the subject  upon what principle  then  can it be denied to the state of missouri  the power flows from the sovereign character of the states of the union  sovereign  not merely as respects the federal government except as they have consented to its limitationbut sovereign as respects each other  whether  therefore  the state of missouri will recognise or give effect to the laws of illinois within her territories on the subject of slavery  is a question for her to determine  nor is there any constitutional power in this government that can rightfully control her',\n",

       " 'in answer to this ground  the chief justice  in delivering the opinion of the court  observed   the argument assumes that the six articles which that ordinance declares to be perpetual  are still in force in the states since formed within the territory  and admitted into the union  if this proposition could be maintained  it would not alter the question  for the regulations of congress  under the old confederation or the present constitution  for the government of a particular territory  could have no force beyond its limits  it certainly could not restrict the power of the states  within their respective territories  nor in any manner interfere with their laws and institutions  nor give this court control over them',\n",
       " 'the ordinance in question  he observes  if still in force  could have no more operation than the laws of ohio in the state of kentucky  and could not influence the decision upon the rights of the master or the slaves in that state',\n",
       " 'this view  thus authoritatively declared  furnishes a conclusive answer to the distinction attempted to be set up between the extra territorial effect of a state law and the act of congress in question',\n",
       " 'it must be admitted that congress possesses no power to regulate or abolish slavery within the states  and that  if this act had attempted any such legislation  it would have been a nullity  and yet the argument here  if there be any force in it  leads to the result  that effect may be given to such legislation  for it is only by giving the act of congress operation within the state of missouri  that it can have any effect upon the question between the parties  having no such effect directly  it will be difficult to maintain  upon any consistent reasoning  that it can be made to operate indirectly upon the subject',\n",
       " 'the argument  we think  in any aspect in which it may be viewed  is utterly destitute of support upon any principles of constitutional law  as  according to that  congress has no power whatever over the subject of slavery within the state  and is also subversive of the established doctrine of international jurisprudence  as  according to that  it is an axiom that the laws of one government have no force within the limits of another  or extra territorially  except from the consent of the latter',\n",
       " 'it is perhaps not unfit to notice  in this connection  that many of the most eminent statesmen and jurists of the country entertain the opinion that this provision of the act of congress  even within the territory to which it relates  was not authorized by any power under the constitution  the doctrine here contended for  not only upholds its validity in the territory  but claims for it effect beyond and within the limits of a sovereign statean effect  as insisted  that displaces the laws of the state  and substitutes its own provisions in their place',\n",
       " 'the consequences of any such construction are apparent  if congress possesses the power  under the constitution  to abolish slavery in a territory  it must necessarily possess the like power to establish it  it cannot be a one sided power  as may suit the convenience or particular views of the advocates  it is a power  if it exists at all  over the whole subject  and then  upon the process of reasoning which seeks to extend its influence beyond the territory  and within the limits of a state  if congress should establish  instead of abolish  slavery  we do not see but that  if a slave should be removed from the territory into a free state  his status would accompany him  and continue  notwithstanding its laws against slavery  the laws of the free state  according to the argument  would be displaced  and the act of congress  in its effect  be substituted in their place  we do not see how this conclusion could be avoided  if the construction against which we are contending should prevail  we are satisfied  however  it is unsound  and that the true answer to it is  that even conceding  for the purposes of the argument  that this provision of the act of congress is valid within the territory for which it was enacted  it can have no operation or effect beyond its limits  or within the jurisdiction of a state  it can neither displace its laws  nor change the status or condition of its inhabitants',\n",

       " 'it is said  however  that the previous cases and course of decision in the state of missouri on this subject were different  and that the courts had held the slave to be free on his return from a temporary residence in the free state  we do not see  were this to be admitted  that the circumstance would show that the settled course of decision  at the time this case was tried in the court below  was not to be considered the law of the state  certainly  it must be  unless the first decision of a principle of law by a state court is to be permanent and irrevocable  the idea seems to be  that the courts of a state are not to change their opinions  or  if they do  the first decision is to be regarded by this court as the law of the state  it is certain  if this be so  in the case before us  it is an exception to the rule governing this court in all other cases  but what court has not changed its opinions  what judge has not changed his',\n",

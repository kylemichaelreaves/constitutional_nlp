together with the       day view  came to be accepted by early christian thinkers  the theological debate was reflected in the writings of st  augustine  who made a distinction between embryo inanimatus  not yet endowed with a soul  and embryo animatus  he may have drawn upon exodus        at one point  however  he expressed the view that human powers cannot determine the point during

existing state laws  in whole or in part         whereas  abortion  like any other medical procedure  should not be performed when contrary to the best interests of the patient since good medical practice requires due consideration for the patient s welfare and not mere acquiescence to the patient s demand  and  whereas  the standards of sound clinical judgment  which  together with informed patient consent should be determinative according to the merits of each individual case  therefore be it  resolved  that abortion is a medical procedure and should be performed only by a duly licensed physician and surgeon in an accredited hospital acting only after consultation with two other physicians chosen because of their professional competency and in conformance with standards of good medical practice and the medical practice act of his state  and be it further  resolved  that no physician or other professional personnel shall be compelled to perform any act which violates his good medical judgment  neither physician  hospital  nor hospital personnel shall be required to perform any act violative of personally held moral principles  in these circumstances good medical practice requires only that the physician or other professional personnel withdraw from the case so long as the withdrawal is consistent with good medical practice   proceedings of the ama house of delegates      june               the principles of medical ethics of the ama do not prohibit a physician from performing an abortion that is performed in accordance with good medical practice and under circumstances that do not violate the laws of the community in which he practices   in the matter of abortions  as of any other medical procedure  the judicial council becomes involved whenever there is alleged violation of the principles of medical ethics as established by the house of delegates          uniform abortion act  section     abortion defined  when authorized     a   abortion  means the termination of human pregnancy with an intention other than to produce a live birth or to remove a dead fetus    b  an abortion may be performed in this state only if it is performed       by a physician licensed to practice medicine  or osteopathy  in this state or by a physician practicing medicine  or osteopathy  in the employ of the government of the united states or of this state   and the abortion is performed  in the physician s office or in a medical clinic  or  in a hospital approved by the  department of health  or operated by the united states  this state  or any department  agency  or political subdivision of either   or by a female upon herself upon the advice of the physician  and      within      weeks after the commencement of the pregnancy  or after      weeks only if the physician has reasonable cause to believe  i  there is a substantial risk that continuance of the pregnancy would endanger the life of the mother or would gravely impair the physical or mental health of the mother   ii  that the child would be born with grave physical or mental defect  or  iii  that the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest  or illicit intercourse with a girl under the age of    years    section     penalty   any person who performs or procures an abortion other than authorized by this act is guilty of a  felony  and  upon conviction thereof  may be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding          or to imprisonment  in the state penitentiary  not exceeding    years   or both   section     uniformity of interpretation   this act shall be construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this act among those states which enact it   section     short title   this act may be cited as the uniform abortion act   section     severability   if any provision of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid  the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application  and to this end the provision of this act are severable   section     repeal   the following acts and parts of acts are repealed                  section     time of taking effect   this act shall take effect              this act is based largely upon the new york abortion act following a review of the more recent laws on abortion in several states and upon recognition of a more liberal trend in laws on this subject  recognition was given also to the several decisions in state and federal courts which show a further trend toward liberalization of abortion laws  especially during the first trimester of pregnancy   recognizing that a number of problems appeared in new york  a shorter time period for  unlimited  abortions was advisable  the time period was bracketed to permit the various states to insert a figure more in keeping with the different conditions that might exist among the states  likewise  the language limiting the place or places in which abortions may be performed was also bracketed to account for different conditions among the states  in addition  limitations on abortions after the initial  unlimited  period were placed in brackets so that individual states may adopt all or any of these reasons  or place further restrictions upon abortions after the initial period   this act does not contain any provision relating to medical review committees or prohibitions against sanctions imposed upon medical personnel refusing to participate in abortions because of religious or other similar reasons  or the like  such provisions  while related  do not directly pertain to when  where  or by whom abortions may be performed  however  the act is not drafted to exclude such a provision by a state wishing to enact the same         see  for example  ywca v  kugler      f supp              d c n j        abele v  markle      f supp                d c conn        newman  j

we are not aware that in the taking of any census under this clause  a fetus has ever been counted        when texas urges that a fetus is entitled to fourteenth amendment protection as a person  it faces a dilemma  neither in texas nor in any other state are all abortions prohibited  despite broad proscription  an exception always exists  the exception contained in art        for an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother  is typical  but if the fetus is a person who is not to be deprived of life without due process of law  and if the mother s condition is the sole determinant  does not the texas exception appear to be out of line with the amendment s command  there are other inconsistencies between fourteenth amendment status and the typical abortion statute  it has already been pointed out  n      supra  that in texas the woman is not a principal or an accomplice with respect to an abortion upon her  if the fetus is a person  why is the woman not a principal or an accomplice  further  the penalty for criminal abortion specified by art       is significantly less than the maximum penalty for murder prescribed by art       of the texas penal code  if the fetus is a person  may the penalties be different        cf  the wisconsin abortion statute  defining  unborn child  to mean  a human being from the time of

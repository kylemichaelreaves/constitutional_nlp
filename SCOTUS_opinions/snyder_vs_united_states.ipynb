       " 'Section 201(b) similarly makes it a crime for federal officials to “corruptly” accept a payment “in return for” “being influenced” in an official act.',\n",
       " '[2] By contrast, §666 bears little resemblance to §201(c), the gratuities provision for federal officials, which contains no express mens rea requirements and simply makes it a crime for federal officials to accept a payment “for or because of any official act.”[3] Therefore, the dividing line between §201(b)’s bribery provision and §201(c)’s gratuities provision is that bribery requires that the official have a corrupt state of mind and accept (or agree to accept) the payment intending to be influenced in the official act.',\n",
       " 'See United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal., 526 U.S. 398, 404–405 (1999).',\n",
       " 'Section 666 shares the defining characteristics of §201(b)’s bribery provision: the corrupt state of mind and the intent to be influenced in the official act.',\n",
       " 'The statutory text therefore strongly suggests that §666—like §201(b)—is a bribery statute, not a gratuities statute.',\n",
       " 'Second is the statutory history, which reinforces that textual analysis.',\n",
       " 'In 1984, when first enacting §666 for state and local officials, Congress borrowed language from the gratuities statute for federal officials, §201(c).',\n",
       " 'See 18 U. S. C. §666(b) (1982 ed., Supp.',\n",
       " 'II).',\n",
       " 'But just two years later, in 1986, Congress overhauled §666, eliminated the gratuities language, and instead enacted the current language that resembles the bribery provision for federal officials, §201(b).',\n",
       " 'Perhaps Congress in 1986 concluded that federally criminalizing state and local gratuities would significantly intrude on federalism.',\n",
       " 'Whatever the impetus, we know that Congress decided in 1986 to change the law and to model §666 on §201(b), the bribery statute, and not on §201(c), the gratuities statute.',\n",

       " 'We must respect Congress’s choice in 1986.',\n",
       " 'Third is the statutory structure.',\n",
       " 'The Government posits that Congress prohibited bribes and gratuities to state and local officials in a single statutory provision, §666(a)(1)(B).',\n",
       " 'Such a statute would be highly unusual, if not unique.',\n",
       " 'The Government identifies no other provision in the U. S. Code that prohibits bribes and gratuities in the same provision.',\n",

       " 'Therefore, §201(b) makes it a crime for federal officials to accept bribes, while a separate provision, §201(c), makes it a crime for federal officials to accept certain gratuities.',\n",
       " 'The absence of a separate gratuities provision in §666 reinforces that §666 is a bribery statute for state and local officials, not a two-for-one bribery-and-gratuities statute.',\n",
       " 'Fourth are the statutory punishments.',\n",
       " 'For federal officials, Congress has separated bribery and gratuities into two distinct provisions of §201 for good reason: The crimes receive different punishments that “reflect their relative seriousness.” Sun-Diamond, 526 U. S., at 405.',\n",

       " 'Compare §201(b) with §201(c).',\n",
       " 'If the Government were correct that §666 also covered gratuities, Congress would have created an entirely inexplicable regime for state and local officials.',\n",
       " 'For one, even though bribery has been treated as a far more serious offense, Congress would have authorized the same 10-year maximum sentences for (i) gratuities to state and local officials and (ii) bribes to state and local officials.',\n",
       " 'See Sun-Diamond, 526 U. S., at 405.',\n",
       " 'In addition, Congress would have authorized punishing gratuities to state and local officials five times more severely than gratuities to federal officials—10 years for state and local officials compared to 2 years for federal officials.',\n",
       " 'The Government cannot explain why Congress would have created such substantial sentencing disparities.',\n",
       " 'We cannot readily assume that Congress authorized a 2-year sentence for, say, a Cabinet Secretary who accepts an unlawful gratuity while authorizing a 10-year sentence on a local school board member who accepts an identical gratuity.',\n",
       " 'What sense would that make?',\n",
       " 'In short, the inexplicable anomalies ushered in by the Government’s approach powerfully demonstrate that §666 is a bribery statute.',\n",

       " 'Interpreting §666 as a gratuities statute would significantly infringe on bedrock federalism principles.',\n",
